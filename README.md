# CAS Portfolio
My May 2020 IB CAS Portfolio website documents my progress and journey throughout my CAS experiences. This website took approximately 7 hours spanning 2 days to develop from scratch. It uses the [Material Components for the web](https://material.io/develop/web) to create the interface and is hosted with [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/). This website reads and renders an array of JSON objects describing reflections.
